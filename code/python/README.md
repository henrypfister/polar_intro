# Simple Recursive Polar Code Simulation in Python with Numba
- `polar.py` -- Contains all necessary code and can be imported or executed directly
- `polar_notebook.ipynb` -- Contains same code as polar.py but Jupyter notebook that can be directly accessed via Colab
- `polar_test.py` -- Jupyter notebook that imports `polar.py` and demonstrates some use cases
